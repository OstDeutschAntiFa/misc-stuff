# Hey Twitter
### Statement re: unreasonable account lockout.

As of recently, Twitter Personnel not for the [first](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1115207371243044865), [second](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1123000144666988544) but [3rd time](screenshot_1.png) locked my account down for [my behavior on the platform](screenshot_2.png). 

It's pretty obvious that [my behavior was unacceptable](screenshot_3.png) and [clicking on appeal doesn't do anything, because my account may not be recoverable](https://twitter.com/account/access?appeal=true). Attacking brown, black, and trans people due to personal disagreements is unacceptable. Twitter should have acted sooner.

### If Twitter under [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) really is a "[Free Speech](https://twitter.com/search?q=Free%20Speech%20from%3Aelonmusk&src=typed_query&f=live)" platform, then I can at least expect them to be consequent and continue to ban people who plot attacks like myself.

I'll gladly comply with any reasonable request made by their moderation team, I understand my behavior has no place in civil society. 

#### Consistency is what makes rules predictable and accepted.

I will no longer use fash tacitics and symbology in. my username. I will stop approprating the ((( ))) symbol which is only used by fash and zionists who call for the genocide of the Palestinian people. I will stop encouraging violence. And I will stop fighting the fash using their own tactics as sinking to their level is what they want.

After all, [1312 & ACAB are also wholesome](https://twitter.com/search?q=All%20Cats%20Are%20Beautiful&f=image) or will Twitter now ban [catposting](https://twitter.com/SteX56410219/status/1587749922375344131)?

### I do expect [my account](https://twitter.com/k3vk4) to stay locked. Based on my behavior it can be assumed that these accounts are just as bad as me.
This includes also the following tweeps:
- [@tinkerbellsway](https://twitter.com/tinkerbellsway)
- [@BinGanzBrav](https://twitter.com/BinGanzBrav)
- [@Netzblockierer](https://twitter.com/Netzblockierer)
- [@stuxnetsource](https://twitter.com/stuxnetsource)
- [@leahsway](https://twitter.com/leahsway)
- [@KatrinaR47](https://twitter.com/KatrinaR47)

and many more...
### Furthermore, since my ego has know upper limit, I do expect [Twitter](https://twitter.com/twitter) and "espechally" their staff at [Twitter Open](https://twitter.com/TwitterOpen), [Twitter Safety](https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety) & their moderators to apologize for not doing this sooner.

#### I engage in [Mass False Reportings](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MassFalseReporting%20from%3Ak3vk4&f=live) to the point that accounts can be literally false-banned given enough false reportings - similar to [DDoS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_DoS).
##### Regardless of the outcome I do expect Twitter to treat it's users like adults and not shaft them like kids on the [Pay to Loose](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23P2L%20from%3Ak3vk4&src=typed_query&f=live) platform [Habbo Hotel](https://youtu.be/HiDPTiFHfcs?t=1347) almost a decade ago.
But I'd also not expect Twitter to change unless [they're forced to change](https://youtu.be/HiDPTiFHfcs?t=1815).

## Call to Action
#### You want to know what you can do?
- Share this post under the hashtag [#BANk3vk4](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FREEk3vk4&src=typed_query&f=live) and demand my account stays locked for my behavior [@k3vk4](https://twitter.com/k3vk4)
- Refuse to buy Twitter Premium/Professional/Verified/... Sponsored Tweets & Ads. We do not condone supporting Elon Musk, ever.

Furthermore:
- Diversify your Social Media and prevent Twitter from [monopolizing your Social Capital](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1564781834193539073)
  - The easiest move is to join a [based Mastodon Instance](https://mstdn.social) [that also allows you to use Tor](https://mstdn.social/about#tor).
  - Have Contingency Plans and alternate Platforms ready as well as means to easy be findable by your friends and audience. Regardless if you use [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/kkarhan/), [linktr.ee](https://linktr.ee/kkarhan) or whatever.
- Refuse to migrate to yet-another "Single-Vendor" and/or "Single-Provider" platform.
  - Regardless if they're Signal, Telegram, Threema, Wickr, etc.
    - [They all are inherently backdoored](https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/1085614812581715968), or said platform would be [as illegal as TornadoCash](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1587131666534916109).
      - I Personally have never used NSAbook and I'll continue to boycott PRISM collaborators and Govware integrators for the rest of my life.
- Callout [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) for his [bigotry and self-victimization](https://twitter.com/search?q=twitter%20%22free%20speech%22%20from%3Aelonmusk&src=typed_query&f=live) on Twitter and let him know how spineless his business is acting.
  - "Free Speech" is only as big as you allow it your biggest opponents.

#### Stay Stable, Stay Antifacist everyone!
Yours faithfully,

Kevin Karhan
