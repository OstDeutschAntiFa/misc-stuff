# Hey Twitter
### Statement re: unreasonable account lockout.

As of recently, Twitter Personnel not for the [first](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1115207371243044865), [second](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1123000144666988544) but [3rd time](screenshot_1.png) locked my account down for [no reason whatsoever](screenshot_2.png). 

It's pretty obvious that [there is no tweet to be deleted](screenshot_3.png) and [clicking on appeal doesn't do anything](https://twitter.com/account/access?appeal=true).

### If Twitter under [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) really is a "[Free Speech](https://twitter.com/search?q=Free%20Speech%20from%3Aelonmusk&src=typed_query&f=live)" platform, then I can at least expect them to be consequent.

I'll gladly comply with any reasonable request made by their moderation team, if they were to actually cite what they find inacceptable and [not randomly act](screenshot_5.png) [opposite to past decisions](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1553772021913456641).

#### Consistency is what makes rules predictable and accepted.

As long as Twitter literally upholds [several](https://twitter.com/1Hknkrz) [accounts](https://twitter.com/JHknkrz) [that have](https://twitter.com/hlkstdnr) "[HKNKRZ](https://www.belltower.news/hkn-krz-htlr-ntnl-szlst-42790/)" as literal handle and name on their platform, they should also allow [#PNCHZNS](https://twitter.com/search?q=PNCH%20NZS&f=live) as equally non-threatening expression.

After all, [1312 & ACAB are also wholesome](https://twitter.com/search?q=All%20Cats%20Are%20Beautiful&f=image) or will Twitter now ban [catposting](https://twitter.com/SteX56410219/status/1587749922375344131)?

### I do expect [my account](https://twitter.com/k3vk4) and everyone else who has been unjustly locked out to have their accounts reinstated.
This includes also the following tweeps:
- [@tinkerbellsway](https://twitter.com/tinkerbellsway)
- [@BinGanzBrav](https://twitter.com/BinGanzBrav)
- [@Netzblockierer](https://twitter.com/Netzblockierer)
- [@stuxnetsource](https://twitter.com/stuxnetsource)
- [@leahsway](https://twitter.com/leahsway)
- [@KatrinaR47](https://twitter.com/KatrinaR47)

and many more...
### Furthermore I do expect [Twitter](https://twitter.com/twitter) and espechally their staff at [Twitter Open](https://twitter.com/TwitterOpen), [Twitter Safety](https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety) & their moderators to apologize and actually change things for the better.
#### [Mass False Reportings are rampant](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MassFalseReporting%20from%3Ak3vk4&f=live) to the point that accounts can be literally false-banned given enough false reportings - similar to [DDoS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_DoS).
##### Regardless of the outcome I do expect Twitter to treat it's users like adults and not shaft them like kids on the [Pay to Loose](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23P2L%20from%3Ak3vk4&src=typed_query&f=live) platform [Habbo Hotel](https://youtu.be/HiDPTiFHfcs?t=1347) almost a decade ago.
But I'd also not expect Twitter to change unless [they're forced to change](https://youtu.be/HiDPTiFHfcs?t=1815).

## Call to Action
#### You want to know what you can do?
- Share this post under the hashtag [#FREEk3vk4](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FREEk3vk4&src=typed_query&f=live) and demand reinstation of my account [@k3vk4](https://twitter.com/k3vk4)
- Refuse to buy Twitter Premium/Professional/Verified/... Sponsored Tweets & Ads until Twitter gets their act together.

Furthermore:
- Diversify your Social Media and prevent Twitter from [monopolizing your Social Capital](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1564781834193539073)
  - The easiest move is to join a [based Mastodon Instance](https://mstdn.social) [that also allows you to use Tor](https://mstdn.social/about#tor).
  - Have Contingency Plans and alternate Platforms ready as well as means to easy be findable by your friends and audience. Regardless if you use [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/kkarhan/), [linktr.ee](https://linktr.ee/kkarhan) or whatever.
- Refuse to migrate to yet-another "Single-Vendor" and/or "Single-Provider" platform.
  - Regardless if they're Signal, Telegram, Threema, Wickr, etc.
    - [They all are inherently backdoored](https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/1085614812581715968), or said platform would be [as illegal as TornadoCash](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1587131666534916109).
      - I Personally have never used NSAbook and I'll continue to boycott PRISM collaborators and Govware integrators for the rest of my life.
- Callout [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) for his [bigotry and self-victimization](https://twitter.com/search?q=twitter%20%22free%20speech%22%20from%3Aelonmusk&src=typed_query&f=live) on Twitter and let him know how spineless his business is acting.
  - "Free Speech" is only as big as you allow it your biggest opponents.

#### Stay Stable, Stay Antifacist everyone!
Yours faithfully,

Kevin Karhan
